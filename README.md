# What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration in open source community. It motivates open source contributors as well as first-time contributors. For the first time contributor, it's a bit hard or overwhelming but the fun part is "Everyone is welcome"

# Event Details:

Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

# Rules:
To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
